# Cloud Security Journeys & Multi-Cloud Musings

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the fascinating and ever-evolving world of cloud security! Here, you'll find my personal recaps and key learnings from various industry conferences, along with my thoughts and musings on security topics across the multi-cloud landscape.

**My Cloud Security Path:**

Like many, my path into the cloud wasn't a straight line. I started my cloud career learning the ropes and building within **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. Now, I'm deeply immersed in the innovative world of **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. My goal is to expand my horizons further and dive into **Microsoft Azure** by the end of this year. As a career changer myself, I understand the value of hearing from others who have navigated similar transitions, and I hope my experiences can offer some insights and encouragement.

**What you'll find here:**

* **Conference Recaps:** Detailed summaries and key takeaways from conferences I've attended, focusing on cloud security announcements, best practices, and emerging trends relevant to AWS, GCP, and (eventually) Azure. Expect in-depth looks at sessions, expo floor experiences, and valuable resources shared.
* **Multi-Cloud Security Musings:** My personal thoughts, opinions, and analysis on various cloud security challenges, solutions, and emerging threats across different cloud providers. This section will explore the nuances and commonalities of securing workloads in a multi-cloud environment.
* **Valuable Resources:** Links to articles, documentation, tools, and other resources that I've found particularly helpful in my journey across AWS, GCP, and my upcoming exploration of Azure.

**Why I created this repository:**

As a career changer now working as a Cloud Security Engineer, I believe in the power of shared experiences. My journey has been one of continuous learning, and I hope this repository can serve as a testament to that. By sharing my conference takeaways and multi-cloud security musings, I aim to connect with others on similar paths and contribute back to the community that has helped me along the way.

**How to use this repository:**

Feel free to browse the different directories and files. Each conference recap or security musing will typically be in its own Markdown file. You can read them directly here on GitHub or clone the repository to keep a local copy.
